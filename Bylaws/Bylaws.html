  An INACTIVE MEMBER</B> is an Active Member who has been put on inactive status. 
  Requests for inactive status shall be made to the Club President or Treasurer, 
  in writing or by E-mail. Inactive membership status shall become effective on 
  the first day of the month following receipt of such a notification. An inactive 
  member shall not be required to pay monthly dues. He/She shall pay any and all 
  assessments that other members are required to pay. The assessments may be accumulated 
  and paid at time of return to active member status. All inactive members will 
  be billed in January for accumulated assessments. Should the total amount of 
  the accumulated assessments equal the amount due if the member should resign, 
  the inactive member will be considered as a resignee. An Inactive Member shall 
  not have flying privileges, and normally will not be covered 
  by any flight insurance policies of the Club. For an Active Member who requests 
  inactive status, said member must remain on inactive status for a minimum period 
  as set forth in </FONT></TT> <TT><FONT FACE="Courier"><A HREF="BylawsA.html">Appendix
