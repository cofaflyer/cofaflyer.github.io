	<h2>Welcome to our flying club!</h2>
	<p>Central Ohio Flyers is a shared ownership club based at the Ohio
		State airport in Columbus, Ohio. The club currently owns two aircraft:
		Cessna 172M and Cessna 182 Skylane.</p>

			size="+2"><font size="+1"><b>ONVENIENCE</b> : Reserving
				an airplane for your flights at COFA is easy. We use an internet
				scheduling system that is available 24X7 to show aircraft
				availability and instantly confirms your reservation. COFA airplanes
				are based at OSU's Don Scott Airport at the corner of Bethel and
				West Case roads in northwest Columbus, just minutes from anywhere in
				the metropolitan area. We have one tie-down on the east ramp and two
				of the planes are kept in hangers D5 and D6, which not only protects
				them but is great for those frosty mornings. Heated hangers are
				available on the field at a modest per use charge if you love those
				flights on clear cold days but like to preflight in comfort. OSU
				also provides pull-out and push-back service on request. Hanger D5
				houses our office with a desk and a phone for a preflight planning,
				weather briefings, and flight plan filing. KOSU is served with ILS,
				NDB, VOR/DME/RNAV and GPS approaches and has a direct frequency link
				to Columbus approach radar.</font></font>

			size="+2"><font size="+1"><b>WNERSHIP</b> : When you
				join COFA, you receive all the benefits of being an aircraft owner
				while avoiding many of the hassles. The COFA philosophy is simple -
				each member owns a share of all club aircraft. We attract quality
				members who take pride in their aircraft and operate them with an
				owner's care rather than with the less attentive attitude of some
				renter's. COFA's quality experience is rooted in ownership because
				it is a formula proven throughout the club's 39+ years.</font></font>
	</p>
	<p>
		<font size="+3"><b><font color="#FF0000">F</font></b></font><font
			size="+2"><font size="+1"><b>LIGHT TIMES</b>: COFA's
				aircrafts are among the most available in Central Ohio. COFA limits
				club size, ensuring the most value for your flying dollar. Your
				financial commitment won't be wasted due to aircraft being
				frequently unavailable when you want them. We have no minimum or
				maximum flying times and members have 24hour access and their own
				keys to each aircraft. Family membership are available to ensure
				that none of your family misses out on the opportunity to fly with
				COFA. You can even schedule that two-week flying vacation and longer
				times may be approved with prior notice.</font></font>
	</p>
	<p>
		<font size="+3"><b><font color="#FF3333">A</font></b></font><font
			size="+2"><font size="+1"><b>FFORDABLE FLYING</b> :
				Most quality conscious people are also concerned about value. COFA
				is the best value for people who fly between 35 and 100 hours per
				year. In this range COFA's rate structure is much more attractive
				than renting and we share the &quot;fixed periodic&quot; costs of
				aircraft care and maintenance among the members to make it more
				affordable then single ownership. Once you are accepted as a COFA
				member, you immediately become one of the named insured on our
				policies so additional renter insurance is not required. Among other
				things, that means that your membership includes a substantial
				amount of liability protection. The financial strength of the club
				also provides a buffer to those unscheduled costs that are
				inevitably associated with aircraft operation. Flight time is billed
				based on Tach time, not Hobbs meter time which saves you from 10% to
				15%. For those who wish to take extended trips with our planes,
				there is no daily minimum. If you fly an hour out, stay a week, and
				fly an hour back, you incur only 2 hours of flight time, not a
				week's worth of daily minimum hours.</font></font>
