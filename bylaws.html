<h3>Bylaws OF CENTRAL OHIO FLYERS ASSOCIATION [COFA INC]</h3>
<br/> (Revised Feb 2018)
<br/>
<br/> ARTICLE I - PURPOSE
<br/>
<br/> The purpose of this corporation (hereinafter called the
"Club") shall be to provide aircraft for the non-commercial enjoyment of
club members, and to perform any and all acts which are lawful under the
laws of the State of Ohio.
<br/>
<br/> ARTICLE II - MEMBERSHIP
<br/>
<br/> A. Qualification, Eligibility, and Initial Investment for
Membership
<br/> Applicants for membership must be of good moral character,
responsible, and financially able to meet their obligations to the Club.
They must possess or have the ability to procure all licenses,
certificates or permits required by any Governmental agency for the
operation of aircraft. Applicants must complete an application and
submit an Initial Investment plus a Processing Fee as set forth in
<a href="AppendixA.html">Appendix A</a>. Acceptance of membership shall
be obtained only through the approval of the majority of the Board of
Trustees. Should acceptance be denied, all monies, except the processing
fee, shall be returned.
<br/>
<br/> B. Ownership of Assets
<br/>
<br/> B1. Member Share. Each member shall be deemed to own an equal
share of the Equity ( assets minus liabilities ) of the Club.
<br/>
<br/> B2. Dissolution Valuation. In the event of the dissolution of
COFA inc., the trustees are empowered to dispose of all assets,
liquidate all COFA inc. debt, return current members initial investment
as well as any of their subsequent investment in the form of monthly
assessments. The trustees will then distribute any remaining funds
equally to all eligible active members, inactive members and suspended
members.
<br/>
<br/> B3. Member Equity Value. The Member Equity Value is calculated
by taking the end of month Balance Sheet Equity (Total Assets minus
Total Liabilities) divided by the total of the ACTIVE, INACTIVE, and
SUSPENDED Members' shares.&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/>
<br/> C. Classes of Membership
<br/>
<br/> C1. An ACTIVE MEMBER is one who is required to pay all dues,
assessments, or other charges levied against such member on a monthly
basis. Members of this class shall be entitled to operate all aircraft
owned and/or leased by the Club provided such member is qualified to
operate such aircraft and meets the minimum requirements as stipulated
by the Club's insurance provider. A member must be an active member for
12 calendar months prior to COFA's dissolution in order to receive any
asset distribution other than his/her initial investment. When an Active
Member sponsors one or more Family Members, the sponsoring Active Member
is entirely responsible for all the financial obligations due the Club
by said Family Member(s).&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/> C2. An INACTIVE MEMBER is an Active Member who has been put on
inactive status. Requests for inactive status shall be made to the Club
President or Treasurer, in writing or by E-mail. Inactive membership
status shall become effective on the first day of the month following
receipt of such a notification. An inactive member shall not be required
to pay monthly dues. He/She shall pay any and all assessments that other
members are required to pay. The assessments may be accumulated and paid
at time of return to active member status. All inactive members will be
billed in January for accumulated assessments. Should the total amount
of the accumulated assessments equal the amount due if the member should
resign, the inactive member will be considered as a resignee. An
Inactive Member shall not have flying privileges, and normally will not
be covered by any flight insurance policies of the Club. For an Active
Member who requests inactive status, said member must remain on inactive
status for a minimum period as set forth in
<a href="AppendixA.html">Appendix A</a>, unless otherwise permitted by
the Board of Trustees.&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/> C3. A FAMILY MEMBER is a spouse of an Active Member, or an
immediate dependent of an Active Member under the age of twenty-four
(24) living in the same household. Acceptance of a Family Member shall
be obtained only through the approval of the majority of the Board of
Trustees. Each family member shall remain a member of COFA only for so
long as his or her sponsoring member remains an Active Member. Each
Family Member shall be afforded the same insurance coverage as provided
to their sponsoring Active Member. A Family Member is subject to the
same rules and regulations as their sponsoring Active Member. Upon
submitting the Family Member application, the sponsoring Active Member
shall include an Initial Investment as set forth in
<a href="AppendixA.html">Appendix A</a>. In addition, each sponsoring
Active Member shall pay a Yearly Fee, as set forth in
<a href="AppendixA.html">Appendix A</a>, for each Family Member they
sponsor. As each Family Member is derivative of a sponsoring Active
Member, they are not entitled to vote, not to be provided COFA notices
in their own right, and they shall schedule their aircraft under their
sponsoring Active Member. Family Members are not subject to any benefits
or distribution upon dissolution, resignation or suspension of
membership. The sponsoring Active Member is wholly responsible for any
charges incurred by the Family Member.
<br/>
<br/> C4. A SUSPENDED MEMBER is an Active Member or Family Member
who has been temporarily denied, by action of the Board of Trustees, the
privilege of flying or reserving any Club aircraft. During the period of
such suspension, the member shall be responsible for the payment of any
and all normal monthly charges. The period of suspension shall be
limited to no more than sixty (60) days. At the end of sixty days the
Board of Trustees shall be required to take further action or the member
shall automatically regain Active Member status.
<br/>
<br/> D. Authorized Number of Active Members
<br/> The number of Active Members shall be limited to insure
availability of aircraft. The maximum number shall be established by the
Board of Trustees, as set forth in
<a href="appendixa.html" target=""><a href="AppendixA.html">Appendix
		A</a></a>.&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/> E. Waiting Lists
<br/> When the Authorized Number of Active Members has been reached,
two Waiting Lists shall be established and maintained by the Treasurer..
<br/>
<br/> E1. Inactive Member Waiting List: When an Inactive Member
wishes to return to Active Member status, they must so indicate their
desire, in writing or E-mail, to the Treasurer. Upon receipt of this
written notice, the Treasure shall determine the date and time of
receipt of the request, and thereby place the member's name, in the
order received, on the Inactive Member Waiting List. This member may not
be placed on the Inactive Member Waiting List if they are in a
delinquent status on any monies owed the Club.
<br/>
<br/> E2. Prospective Member Waiting List: For a prospective member
to have their name placed on the Prospective Member Waiting List, they
must complete an application as set forth in Appendix B, then submit
that application to the Treasurer. The application must be accompanied
with a non-refundable Processing Fee as set forth in
<a href="AppendixA.html">Appendix A</a> (Article II, Section A). Upon
receipt of the application, the Treasurer shall determine the date and
time of receipt of the application, and thereby place the prospective
member's name on the Prospective Member Waiting List. Should the
Prospective Member wish to withdraw their name from the Prospective
Member Waiting List, they must so indicate, in writing or E-mail, to the
Treasurer. Upon receipt of such a request, the Prospective Member's name
will be removed.&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/> E3. Waiting List Selection Process: When an opening for an
Active Member becomes available, the Treasurer shall begin with the
Inactive Member Waiting List, in the order of requests received. Should
there be no member's name on the Inactive Member Waiting List, or should
all member's on this list decline filling the vacancy, the Prospective
Member Waiting List will then be consulted, beginning with names in the
order received. Notification, either verbally or in writing, or E-Mail,
shall be accomplished by either the President or Treasurer. If the
prospective member declines to fill the vacancy, their name shall be
placed on the bottom of the Prospective Member Waiting List, and the
next prospective member will be notified. When a prospective member
indicates that they wish to fill the vacancy, they will have up to seven
(7) days of being so notified in which to get their Initial Investment
(Article II, Section A) to the Treasurer. Should they fail to do so,
their name will be placed at the bottom of the list, and the process
will continue.&nbsp;

shall be provided a copy of the current Waiting Lists upon request.

Certificate, copies of their most recent Flight Review endorsements
(i.e. BFR), as well as copies of any other flight related information
the Trustees deem necessary. Members who do not have a current FAA
medical certificate, or who do not have an up-to-date Flight Review
endorsement, or who have not provided copies of their check ride
endorsements, shall not operate COFA aircraft without a Certified Flight
Instructor accompanying them. Members who do not provide this data in a
timely manner, as set forth in
<a href="AppendixA.html">Appendix A</a>, will be unable to reserve
aircraft, and may lose all future reservations, unless special
arrangements have been made with the Trustees.&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/> H. Viewing of insurance policies.
<br/> The Club shall make available the aircraft insurance policy
for member's review, and all members shall be responsible for the
provisions therein.&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/> ARTICLE VIII - AIRCRAFT RESERVATION PARAMETERS
<br/>
<br/> A. The Board of Trustees shall insure that all members shall
have reasonable opportunity to use club airplanes by limiting aircraft
use, as set forth in
<a href="AppendixA.html">Appendix A</a>. This is to prevent any one
member monopolizing the same. Limitations may include scheduling
parameters on the reservation system which prohibits sequential
scheduling or a limit on the number of reservations that may be
scheduled.&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/> ARTICLE IX- ACTIONS RESERVED FOR THE GENERAL MEMBERSHIP
<br/>
<br/> A. Dissolution must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote
of the members. The dissolution vote is to be conducted at a General
Membership Meeting.&nbsp;
<br/> B. Aircraft Sale or Purchase. The sale or purchase of Club
aircraft, in principle, must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote
of the Members.
