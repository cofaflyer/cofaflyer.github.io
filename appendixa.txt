Fuel cost per gal - Current OSU Airport price at time of billing.
--- Fuel purchase rebate program (KATS) ---
KATS (Keep All The Savings) is designed to encourage members to top-off at outlying airports where fuel charges are less than our home base airport. If the charge per gallon is less than OSU's, a KATS rebate applies. If the charge per gallon is more than OSU's, a member may only deduct the equivalent OSU fuel charge. You receive full credit at OSU rates per gallon for fuel purchased at an FBO other than OSU. To receive KATS credit for fuel purchases at FBOs other than OSU, add the gallons from all receipts presented for credit. The fuel credit is calculated by multiplying the total gallons from all receipts by the current OSU Airport Fuel price per gallon that is reported on your monthly billing statement. Subtract the calculated fuel credit from your monthly payment. Submit copies of the receipts with your payment.
